Freezing a channel prevents users from sending new messages and adding or deleting reactions.

Sending a message to a frozen channel returns an error message. Attempting to add or delete reactions returns a `403 Not Allowed` error.

User roles with the `UseFrozenChannel` permission can still use frozen channels normally. By default, no user role has this permission.

## Freeze a Channel

```php
$channel->update(["frozen" => true]);
```

## Unfreeze a Channel

```php
$channel->update(["frozen" => false]);
```

## Granting the Frozen Channel Permission

Permissions are typically managed in the [Stream Dashboard](https://dashboard.getstream.io/) under your app's **Roles & Permissions** settings. This is the recommended approach for most use cases.

To grant permissions programmatically, update the channel type using a server-side API call. See [user permissions](/chat/docs/php/chat_permission_policies/) for more details.

```php
$response = $client->getChannelType("messaging");

$response["grants"]["admin"][] = "use-frozen-channel";

$client->updateChannelType("messaging", [ "grants" => ["admin" => $response["grants"]["admin"] ] ]);
```
